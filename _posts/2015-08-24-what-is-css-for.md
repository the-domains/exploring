# WHAT IS CSS FOR?

HTML is by default: responsive, vector, and highly readable on any device. Think about that for a second.

There is an abundance of CSS on the web that constricts these built-in features of HTML. I believe that as CSS authors, we have a responsibility to stop this. If you find yourself writing CSS that removes any of these three features, take a minute to stop and rethink its purpose. Ask yourself what problem could be so important that it's worth solving at the cost of universal access to your content & readability?

CSS is not here to make our lives as developers easy. It's here to enhance the usability of the web for our users. **CSS should never** limit usability.

When we write stylesheets that cascade, we should keep these simple points in mind.
